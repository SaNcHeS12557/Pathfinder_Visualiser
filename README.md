# Pathfinder Visualizer

üë£ **Pathfinder Visualizer** is an educational C++ tool built with **SFML**, designed to visually demonstrate how pathfinding algorithms work

Currently, the **A\* (A-Star)** algorithm is implemented and fully functional

---

## üîç Overview

This application functions like a simple paint tool, allowing users to:

- Draw obstacles on a grid
- Set start and end points
- Run a pathfinding algorithm and observe its execution in real time
- Learn how search algorithms explore paths and make decisions

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies

- **C++**
- **SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)**

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Install [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/)
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaNcHeS12557/Pathfinder_Visualiser.git
   ```
3. Build the project (e.g., using CMake or g++ manually)
4. Run the executable
